m2m is a lightweight communication library for developing client-server or pub-sub applications using the machine-to-machine framework [node-m2m](https://www.node-m2m.com).

Instantly connect machines or endpoints from anywhere communicating through the internet, WAN or LAN in real-time.

Create *m2m applications* where endpoints distributed around the globe communicate and exchange data traversing the internet/WAN using a combination of http and websocket protocol.

Create *edge applications* where endpoints communicate through local area networks using tcp or udp protocol for a super-fast low latency edge computing environment.

Its simple api and software-defined computing environment makes it easy to create any applications requiring a secure dynamic networking path that can traverse any regional boundaries using the public internet and private LANs.

Access to endpoints is restricted to authenticated and authorized users only ensuring a secure endpoint access (SEA) everytime.

All communications traffic between endpoint devices are fully encrypted using TLS or a combination of standard public and private encryptions based on NIST.
