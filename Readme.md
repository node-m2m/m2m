m2m is a node.js communication library for developing client-server or pub-sub applications using the machine-to-machine and edge framework [node-m2m](https://www.node-m2m.com).

Its simple api and software-defined computing environment makes it easy to create any distributed applications requiring a secure networking path that can traverse any regional and local area network boundaries using the public internet and private LANs.

Create *m2m applications* where endpoints distributed around the globe communicate and exchange data traversing the internet/WAN using a combination of http and websocket protocol.

Create *edge applications* where endpoints communicate through local area networks using tcp or udp protocol for a super-fast low latency edge computing environment.

Access to endpoints is restricted to authenticated and authorized users only.

All communications traffic between endpoints are encrypted using TLS or hybrid encryption based on NIST.

To use this library, users will need to <a href="https://www.node-m2m.com/m2m/account/create" target="_blank">register</a> with node-m2m.

Start your first m2m application from the [quick tour](https://github.com/Node-M2M/M2M-Quicktour) guide.
